# groundfishr

The goal of groundfishr is to create a clear workflow for pulling and cleaning data for fishery stock assessments at AFSC.
It utilizes a "project oriented workflow" via RStudio (base R is ok, though you must use `here::here()`).
You must be able to have a connection to the AFSC & AKFIN (Answers) data servers (e.g., VPN if offsite), and have usernames/passwords setup.
