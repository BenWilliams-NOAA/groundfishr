The goal of `groundfishr` is to create a clear workflow for pulling and cleaning data for fishery stock assessments based upon the ADMB rockfish assessment framework 
It utilizes a "project oriented workflow" via RStudio (base R is ok, though you must use `here::here()`). 
You must be able to have a connection to the AFSC & AKFIN (Answers) data servers (e.g., VPN if offsite), and have usernames/passwords setup.

## Installation
The `groundfishr` package can be installed from [github](https://github.com/BenWilliams-NOAA/groundfishr) with:
```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BenWilliams/groundfishr")
```

```{r setup}
library(groundfishr)
```
